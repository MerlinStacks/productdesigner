# CustomKings Product Personalizer – Changelog

## Version 1.1.1 – 2025-05-16

**What's New & Improved:**
- **Pick Your Accent Color:** Choose your favorite accent color for the plugin in the settings. The new color picker supports both HEX and RGB!

- **Modern Layers Panel:** The designer's Layers panel is now sleek and user-friendly, with a clear bar layout and easy-to-use icons.
- **Clearer Documentation:** We've made the changelog and help docs easier to read and more helpful.
